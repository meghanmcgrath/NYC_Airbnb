# NYC_Airbnb
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC to make predictions and draw conclusions.

## **Key Questions and Objectives:**
* Is there evidence of spatial autocorrelation in listing prices or booking patterns? Are nearby listings more similar to each other in terms of pricing and popularity than listings farther apart?
* Are there any specific features that correlate with higher ratings or booking frequency?
* Can we forecast future demand or pricing trends based on historical data using time series analysis techniques?

## **Data**
This public dataset is part of Airbnb, and the original source can be found on insideairbnb.com.
